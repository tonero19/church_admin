This is an application for church administration. It is a tool that supports data persistence so that all church information can be persisted, modified and presented through a dashboard (work in progress).

Access to the tool is role based.
There are currently three roles within the tool, namely: member, admin and manager.
Some pages may not be accessible based on the user's roles.

The tool is still under development, however, the latest version can be seen https://church-admin-app.herokuapp.com/showMyLoginPage

NB: This app was developed as a hobby. It is not meant to be used for commercial purposes.

In the demo, the user has a role of 'member'. He/she has access to view general (non-sensitive) information but is not allowed to modify and by extension persist information in the app.

Please contact me if you require a more comprehensive demo.
